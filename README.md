 RNN and CNN
 
   The repository contains two projects - 1)Based on CNN(Counvolutional neural network)
 >
                                     2)Based on RNN(Recurrent neural network)
 >
 # 1) CNN : 
 
 *This model identifies flowers in an image!!*
   >
   >
   Model classifies feeded image into 5 classes -

     Directory contains -
   >
   Code which downloads data from Kaggle , segregates data into training and validation set , preprocessing image,
   building model, training , testing with manually collected data from another source, plotting graph, and *lets you to upload
   and test model*
   >
   A ppt ( explaining structure of neural network , detailed info , graphs , images)
   >
   
 
   
   
 # 2) RNN :
   
   *A model which can guess your emotions from sentence!!!*
   >
   >
   Model basically reads the sentence and predicts responce- POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL
   >
     This directory contains-
   >
   Code which loads dataset , preprocessing(tokenizer,embedding) , model building, training, testing, graph
   plotting(accuracy and loss)
   >
   A ppt (which explains detailed version of project , graphs, gif)
   >
   Datatset
   >
   Dataset is collected from various sources - kaggle , imdb , tweets
